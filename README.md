### How to Run
To get up an running you need to first do a NPM install (we do use a 3rd party
library to do the json file save/read). Then npm start and you 
should be good to go.

### Brief Overview
This game is a simple implementation of pokemon. It has a simple story
once you complete the simple quest, your total battle wins will be 
recorded to the server (and only then). 

Movement is defaulted to the arrow keys though you can map them to other keys.
The A btn is used to select text items in battle and continue a dialog.
The B btn is to go to a previous menu inside the battle (currently no other
implementation). 

To speak with people you must first go up to their face and walk up, people
will not speak wiht you from their side or back (this is rude).

Different people throughout your adventure can do different things. Some 
may heal your pokemon, others may give you advice on where to go. On top of
that there are several road signs that can help you make sure you are on
the right track.
